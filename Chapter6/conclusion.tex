\chapter{Conclusion}

We propose a novel approach which employs spatial safety in compiled binaries, with no source code support and no changes in compiler or operating system software. Our approach is based on SoftBound technique, which stores bounds metadata per instruction owner. Instruction owner and their access instruction information is predicted by using reverse engineering techniques. Instruction owner is nothing but variable (e.g. pointer) defined in actual source code (determined by reverse engineering). Instrumentation checks are added on every load and store instructions and checks are made based on the bounds information of that instruction owner, which is associated with the instruction. Instruction owner information is determined using static analysis and reverse engineering techniques, and run time checks are added using dynamic instrumentation techniques. We use Ghidra for static analysis and Pin framework to add dynamic instrumentation. Our technique was able to detect about 57\% of test cases with about 6\% overhead on top of minimal Pintool overhead. In future work section, we propose work needed to increase the detection percentage to further improve this technique.
